# Ranked-Choice Voting System
My first major C++ project - a voting system where voters rank candidates and the winner is determined by a point system.

## About This Project

Built this during my first semester learning C++ (2025) as part of my first semester project for my Computer Programming Course. Voters rank all candidates, and points are awarded based on preference rankings. The candidate with the most points wins!

## What I Learned

- Working with 2D arrays
- Nested loops
- Input validation
- Implementing real algorithms (Borda count)

## How to Run
```bash
g++ voting_system.cpp -o voting
./voting
```

## Features

- 1-10 candidate support
- Any number of voters
- Input validation
- Clear results display

## My Experience

This is the first major and actually usable program I've written in my programming career, and it took a lot of effort and programmer's block 😭🙏🙏. 

But we got through it! I used all the logic I could, working with everything that's been taught to us in class so far, and I'm personally very proud of this project - with many more to come in the future. 

There are many changes I plan to make to enhance the user experience, including adding Graphical User Interfaces and polishing it to be as good as it can be.
