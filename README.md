# Ranked-Choice Voting System
My first major C++ project - a voting system where voters rank candidates and the winner is determined by a point system.

## About This Project

Built this during my first semester learning C++ (2025) as part of my first semester project for my Computer Programming Course. Voters rank all candidates, and points are awarded based on preference rankings. The candidate with the most points wins!

## What I Learned

- Working with 2D arrays
- Nested loops
- Input validation
- Implementing real algorithms (Borda count)

## How to Run
```bash
g++ voting_system.cpp -o voting
./voting
```

## Features

- 1-10 candidate support
- Any number of voters
- Input validation
- Clear results display

## My Experience
This is the first major and actual usable program I have written in my programming career and it took a lot of effort and programmer blocks 😭🙏🙏.
But we got through I used all logic I could using what everything that has been taught to us in class thus far and I am personally very proud of this project with many more to come in the future. There are many changes I will make to this and furthermore enhace the user experience using Graphical User Interfaces and further polish it to as good as it can be.
